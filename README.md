# CRNA Tailwind
[Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), a ridiculously awesome utility-first CSS framework.

*Note: This is a work in progress. Right now, this includes a React Native-compatible version of the stylesheet generated by Tailwind's default configuration. In the future, the plan is to implement Tailwind correctly and add a script that strips out any CSS rules that are not compatible with React Native and converts the remaining rules into a [StyleSheet](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html).*
